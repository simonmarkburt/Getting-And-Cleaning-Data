Getting-And-Cleaning-Data
=========================

Coursera Data Science Specialisation Course work

Included here is an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. Save to a file the resulting tidy dataset (tidy.txt)
    6. From the tidy data creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    7. Save to a file the resulting tidy dataset (tidy_average.txt)
 
Instruction

    1. The R script uses the following packages data.table and plyr, which will be installed and loaded if they haven't already.
    2. Run the R script from your working directory
    3. Data downloaded will be copied to a new folder called 'UCI HAR Dataset' in your working directory.
    4. The result datasets, tidy.txt and tidy_average.txt will be saved in the working directory
